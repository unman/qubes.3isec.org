<h1>Qubes templates</h1>

All templates are signed with my Qubes OS Signing key:
<pre>
pub   rsa4096 2016-06-25 [SC]
      4B1F 400D F256 51B5 3C41  41B3 8B3F 30F9 C8C0 C2EF
uid           [ unknown] unman (Qubes OS signing key) <unman@thirdeyesecurity.org>
sub   rsa4096 2016-06-27 [S] [expires: 2024-06-30]
sub   rsa4096 2016-06-25 [E]
</pre>

<br>
You can read about how to get a copy of the key, and how to validate it <a href="../index.html">here</a>.
<br>
You will need to copy the key in to dom0:
<br>
<code>
qvm-run -p  qube 'cat PATH_TO_KEY ' > RPM-GPG-KEY-unman
</code>
<br>
and then move it into place:
<br>
<code>
sudo mv RPM-GPG-KEY-unman /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-unman
</code>
<p>
Download the template you want to use, and copy it into dom0:
<br>
<code>
qvm-run -p  QUBE 'cat PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_TEMPLATE ' > TEMPLATE_PACKAGE_NAME
</code>
<br>
replacing <code>TEMPLATE_PACKAGE_NAME</code> with a name of your choice.
<br>
Then check the signature by (e.g):
<br>
<code>
rpm -K TEMPLATE_PACKAGE_NAME
</code>
<br>
<br>
Install the template using qvm-template:
<br>
<code>
qvm-template install --keyring /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-unman FULL_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_TEMPLATE
</code>



<h3>Using qvm-template</h3>
It is also possible to use the native Qubes tools for template management.
<br>
To do this you will need to copy the key to dom0, as above, and move it:
<br>
<code>
sudo mv RPM-GPG-KEY-unman /etc/qubes/repo-templates/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-unman
</code>
<br>
<br>

You will also need to create the repository definition.
<br>
Create a file at /etc/qubes/repo-templates/3isec-templates.repo, with this content:
<pre>
<code>
[3isec-templates]
name = 3isec Qubes Templates Repository (updates)
baseurl = https://qubes.3isec.org/rpm/r$releasever/templates
skip_if_unavailable = False
enabled = 1
metadata_expire = 6h
gpgcheck = 1
gpgkey = file:////etc/qubes/repo-templates/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-unman
</code>
</pre>

Now you can use qvm-template or qvm-template-gui, as normal.




<h2>Rolling distros - Parrot, Arch, Kali</h2>
Templates like Parrot or Kali are based on Debian testing.
<br>
To avoid breakage when updating, the core Qubes packages are on hold. 
<br>
<b>This means that they will not be updated.</b>
<br>
You can confirm this by running <code>apt-mark showhold</code> in the template.
<br>
<code>apt-mark unhold </code> will remove the hold, and allow you to update the Qubes packages.
<br>
I suggest you restore the hold <code>apt-mark hold </code> to make sure that the Qubes packages are not removed when updating other packages.
<br>
<br>
So, while updating a template you will see that some packages cannot be upgraded because they will conflict with the Qubes packages.
<br>
Periodically, in the template, remove the hold on the Qubes packages. Update the package list with <code>apt update</code>  and then update the Qubes packages - either manually with <code>apt install... </code>, or using a manager like aptitude, and selecting Qubes packages for upgrade.
<br>
Once the upgrade has been completed, put the Qubes packages back on hold, and upgrade again.
<p>
Undoubtedly a pain, but less than the pain of breaking your qubes, and having to crawl backwards to get them working again.
<br>
Then again, if you use aptitude you would be able to see what changes would be made, opt to retain the Qubes packages - <b> always keep the Qubes packages</b>, and avoid breakage that way.
This depends on you looking to see what changes will be made and acting accordingly.
Using  <code>apt-mark hold </code> will take some pressure off.
<p>

<H2>Installing large templates</H2>
In 4.1, dom0 is pegged at 20G by default.
<br>
This means that you will not be able to install the larger templates, like parrot, without  taking some action.
<br>
The easiest thing to do is to increase the size of dom0. On a default install you can do this simply enough by:
<br>
<code>
	sudo lvresize --size 40G /dev/qubes_dom0/root
<br>
	sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/qubes_dom0-root
</code>
<p>
For more details and options, look <a href="https://github.com/unman/notes/blob/master/Installing_Templates_Qubes_4.1.md">here</a>.
<p>

<H2>Repository definitions and apt-cacher-ng</H2>
Very often, the repository definitions in these templates are modified to enable use of the apt-cacher-ng caching proxy.
Instead of <code>https://</code> the definitions have <code>http://HTTPS///</code> - this is so that the caching proxy can see the request, and then connect to the repository over https.
You can read about this <a href="https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/html/howtos.html#ssluse">here</a>
<br>
If you use apt-cacher-ng, that's fine. Everything will just work&trade;.
<br>
If you do not use apt-cacher-ng, then you can install it using <a href="https://qubes.3isec.org/tasks.html">this tool</a>.
<br>
If you do not use apt-cacher-ng, or you do not want to use it for <em>this</em> template, edit the repository definitions, replacing 
<code>http://HTTPS///</code> with <code>https://</code> 
<br>
<br>
<em>Always check that the repository definitions suit your use case.</em>
